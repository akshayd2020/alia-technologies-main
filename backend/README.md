# Backend

This is the backend server we'll be using for our API. It's main responsiblities include managing the Postgres database, exposing a GraphQL api to the `customer-app` (and eventually the `merchant-app`), and exposing the default
REST endpoints that Shopify generates for a basic Shopify app. A lot of this code was autogenerated by the `Shopify CLI`, so keep in mind that we might want to restructure a lot of it to fit our needs. Feel free to make any suggestions that
come to mind!

## What are the sub-directores/files of this backend?
- `index.ts` is the main function for this server. It sets up the HTTP server and all of our endpoints
- `graphql` handles all of our GraphQL API needs
- `prisma` handles the Prisma configuration/schema type stuff. We'll probably want to keep our actual database code in a seperate folder, which brings us to
- `data` is where we'll put all of our database functions utilizing the `prisma client` (look in the Prisma README for more information)
- `middleware` is where we can put any HTTP middleware we might want. If you're not familiar with middleware, take a look at https://www.moesif.com/blog/engineering/middleware/What-Is-HTTP-Middleware/. It's basically just functions that execute before
we process each request
- `helpers` not sure what we'll be putting in here, since helper functions are probably better off kept in whatever sub-directory needs them
