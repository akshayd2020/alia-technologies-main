# Extensions

These are the Shopify `theme app extensions` that we create as part of our app. They're basically little widgets that we provide to merchants so they can add them into their online store. For us, we'll probably just use one widget for the rewards popup that you can see in `alia-learn-ext`

If you make any changes to any extensions, you can run `npm run deploy` (I think in the extensions directory) to deploy the new version. Make sure you enable it on the merchant's store. The `alia-learn-ext` should already be enabled on our development store.
